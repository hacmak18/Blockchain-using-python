# Blockchain-using-python
Build a blockchian using python which include all the blokchain concepts.

In this Demo blockchain, Following features are included:
Mining coin

receive coin
block validation

also UI is included in project using flask.

In this project i have implemented each and every concept of blockchain and cryptocurrency. for hashing i have used sha256.

Blockchain behaviour should be decentralized so there are multiple node in this blockchain those can validate the blockchain.
